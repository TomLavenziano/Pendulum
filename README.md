> Through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Pendulum is able to take in a blob of text and extract context along with fuzzy dates and times. Through this extraction and evaluation the system can determine whether the given text contains any reminders, due dates, or past dates.

> Combining the extracted context with the extracted dates allows for the generation of a Smart Note that automatically attaches reminders and dates that are relevant to the notes content.
